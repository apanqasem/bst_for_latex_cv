Provides a Bibtex style file for adding and formatting publications in curriculum vitae. 
Some of the features (these are not available in standard bib style files, TTBOMK): 

   - list publications in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
   - sort publications by both month and year
   - provide publication number by category in label
         - e.g., [C17] for 18th conference publication
         - [J1] = oldest journal publication
   - display publication color by category in label
         - follows DBLP scheme (mostly)

Note, only conference, article and book types are supported currently. Extending for other 
types is relatively straightforward
